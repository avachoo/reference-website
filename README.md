1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders

-Naming conventions should always be lowercase and use dashed lines to seperate two words instead of spaces. Folder names should be similar to file name and content. For example, when creating a css folder, you should name the folder 'css' while naming the file 'style.css'. All folders and assets should be placed inside root folder for easy access and to link to any .html file. Ex. index.html

2. Best practices for commit messages

-Commit messages should be frequently noted and pushed regularly following any updates or changes made to your code. It is best to use past tense within your message and to provide a brief yet detailed summary of changes you made. For example, "updated and styled all divs in body content".

3. What is HTML?

-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard coding language used and displayed in web browsers. In web design, it is used to input all text elements and main content of a web page. HTML is used when organizing content into various sections of a website such as defining a header, body, main content, and a footer. In other words, HTML provides structure and acts as a backbone to any webpage.

4. Proper syntax for HTML tags

-All HTML tags are enclosed between angle brackets. These brackets signify the beginning and end of a particular tag or element. For example, <p> represents the beginning of a paragraph or text. After typing the content we are displaying, we would close the tag using </p> to signify the end of a paragraph.

5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used html tags/elements:

a. h1-h6: is used in HTML to define a header or title of a particular section or article of a webpage. These headers are represented as <h1> to <h6>. Each tag numbered 1 through 6 varies in terms of font size and stroke weight. <h1> is the largest in size and typically used at the top of a webpage, while <h6> is the smallest in size and stroke weight, and can be used to distinguish the title of a smaller article or to emphasize a particular word or piece of content.

b. p: stands for 'paragraph' and is used to define a piece of text within a block of content. The <p> tag contains relevant info to the section or article.

c. lists: ul, ol, dl: lists are used in HTML to list items one after another. <ul> (unordered list) tag displays content as a bulleted list. <ol> (ordered list) displays content as a numerical list, while <dl> (description list)  lists items in a way that allows us to define terms and names.

d. a: stands for "anchor tag" and is used to embed a specific link to another article or webpage, on or off of your page, within a text or paragraph. It can be stylized as an interactive button, or as a navigation/guide within the header content of your page. It is displayed as <a href="insert-link"></a>. It is good to add an aria label to describe what the user will be clicking through so as to incorporate accessibility into your code.

e. img: is a tag used to embed an image (jpg, png, etc) into your webpage. It can be used in any section that requires visuals for either decoration or to serve a particular purpose. Image tags are displayed as <img src="insert-source"></img>. To add accessibility, it is good to add "alt" after inserting the source as it decribes what the user will be looking at.

f. q: is tag used to define short inline quotations.

g. blockquote: is used to define a large, specific section that is quoted from another source.

h. cite: is used to specify a URL that relates to or explains a quote.

i. em: stands for "emphasis" and is used for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to other text. It creates an italic effect on a particular word and can be nested within another tag such as <p>

j. strong: is used to define a particular text or words as an importance or urgency. Using <strong> nested within a <p> tag will result in that word being bold.

k. b: stands for "bold" and is similar to <strong> tag. Nesting within a <p> tag will result in a bold text but does not represent importance.

l. i: stands for "italic" and is used to define a certain part of a text and adds an italic effect.

m. small: defines a smaller text, such as a side-comment or copyright statement. This tag is typically used in the footer of a webpage.

6. A block element occupies the horizontal space of its container and the vertical space equal to the content being displayed. Block elements can force a new line to begin and cause a line break to occur. 

a. html: used to define the beginning of the content within the text portion of a webpage and to define the language

b. head: this block element is situated at the very top of an html file and contains metadata and is responsible for holding information about the document like scripts and style sheets.

c. body: this element contains all the contents of an html page such as the paragraphs, images, lists, etc... It is used typically above the <main> tag.

d. header: this element holds introductory content such as a main title, any logos, and any navigations.

e. nav: responsible for serving as a directory to guide the user to a specific section fo the page. For example, a nav can guide the user to a particular section or article with relevant info.

f. main: contains content that is relevant to the main focus or topic of the webpage. Consists of various organized sections and articles.

g. section: encloses a series of articles revolving around one main idea or topic. It is used as an organization element and creates division between other areas of the webpage.

h. article: encloses one piece of content about a particular event, story or piece of information.

i. div: a widely used block element that can organize multiple pieces of information or content within a "box" or container. Divs can be stylized in CSS to add background colours, outlines, etc

j. aside: defines a portion of content that is not directly related to the main information or topic of the webpage. This is usually used in sidebars.

k. footer: defines information about author of section, copyright and any related links to other articles

l. span: represents a common inline container for organizing content and grouping different sections together. Can be styled using class or id attributes.

m. small: defines small text for side comments or for copyright information nested within the footer of a document.
